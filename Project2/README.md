## Description

The Memory Game Project is a classic "match two" game created as part of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree curriculum.  This project focuses on developing the JavaScript code to create an interactive matching game.  There are 8 pairs of matching symbols arranged in a four-by-four grid.  The cards are randomly shuffled at the beginning of each game or upon game restart.  The game is playable on desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.

## How To Play

To start playing, click any card on the game board to flip over the card and reveal the symbol underneath.  The timer will start on the first click.  The star rating is based on the number of moves performed.  One "move" consists of flipping over two cards.  If the two cards match, they will remain flipped over.  If the two cards do not match, they will be flipped back and the symbols subsequently hidden.  The game ends when all 8 matching pairs are found.

To restart the game, click on the restart button on the right-hand corner above the board.

## Development Details

This project is based upon the starter code found in [this repository](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game).

The code is written in HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.  The images on the cards are from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) version 4.6.1.  The JavaScript functions for the timer and modal elements based on [www.w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com) examples.
